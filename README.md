**Note:** This response assumes you're already familiar with setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. If not, you'll need to install those dependencies first.

**Install core dependencies:**

```bash
npm install @hookform/resolvers @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog @radix-ui/react-icons @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-switch @radix-ui/react-toast @react-email/components @react-email/render ai axios bcryptjs class-variance-authority clsx dayjs embla-carousel-autoplay embla-carousel-react lucide-react mongoose next next-auth openai react react-dom react-email react-hook-form resend tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate usehooks-ts zod
```

**Install development dependencies:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/bcryptjs @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom autoprefixer eslint eslint-config-next postcss tailwindcss typescript
```

**Install Shadcn UI:**

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add <components>
```

Replace `<components>` with the desired components from Shadcn UI.

**Additional notes:**

- Consider using a package manager like `yarn` or `pnpm` for better dependency management.
- You might need to install additional dependencies based on your project's specific requirements.
- For more complex projects, consider using a monorepo structure or a tool like `npm workspaces`.

**Important:** This command list assumes you have all the necessary base dependencies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS already installed. If not, you'll need to install them first.

**Remember:** Always check the official documentation for the latest installation instructions and dependencies for each package.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
